## Student Information

## Original Newspaper
## Name: Jang News Paper Karachi
## Date: 1965
## Source: Google


## Project Description
 ### This project is a digital recreation of a historical 1965 newspaper front page, built entirely using HTML5. The design captures the vintage aesthetic of pre-1990 print media, utilizing a yellowish-beige background to simulate aged paper and classic typography. I used absolute positioning and inline styles to achieve a precise, multi-column layout that mimics the original print structure without relying on external CSS files.
## Features Implemented
### Semantic HTML5 structure (using <header>, <section>, <article>, and <footer>).

### Inline CSS styling for layout, fonts, and "aged paper" color effects.

### Absolute positioning to place headlines and images exactly like a real newspaper.

### Table-based layout for organized data segments.

### Unordered lists (<ul>) to structure key news points.

### Integration of historical images with captions.
## Challenges Faced
### The major challenge I faced was of reading the newspaper. Because I chose the newspaper which is from 1965 and the text visibility was less then 30%. It had lot of columns which was again difficult to implement.
