        In 1965, when Indonesia openly announced its support for Pakistan regarding the Kashmir issue,
        India perceived it as a direct act of hostility. 
        This declaration turned India into an adversary, yet Indonesia remained firm. 
        Their unwavering solidarity proved that they stood shoulder-to-shoulder with 
        Pakistan for the freedom of Kashmiris, regardless of the consequences.
        It was a clear message lasting mark that the people of Indonesia considered the defense of 
        Pakistan as their own personal duty. The alliance was so strong that Indonesia 
        offered to provide military hardware to Pakistan immediately. 
        India viewed this axis as a major threat to its regional dominance. 
        The support from Jakarta was not just symbolic; it was a tangible commitment 
        that left a lasting mark on the history of the 1965.

            In a dramatic turn of events on the battlefield, 
            the Indian aggression was met with a crushing response that forced the enemy into a 
            hasty and disorganized retreat. 
            Overwhelmed by the precision and intensity of the Pakistani counter-offensive, 
            the Indian troops broke formation and fled in panic, 
            prioritizing their safety over their military assets. 
            The scale of their defeat was evident as they abandoned critical weaponry in their wake. 
            Pakistani forces have successfully captured 13 heavy artillery cannons and huge 
            stockpiles of live ammunition that were left behind by the fleeing soldiers.
