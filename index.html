        In 1965, when Indonesia openly announced its support for Pakistan regarding the Kashmir issue,
        India perceived it as a direct act of hostility. 
        This declaration turned India into an adversary, yet Indonesia remained firm. 
        Their unwavering solidarity proved that they stood shoulder-to-shoulder with 
        Pakistan for the freedom of Kashmiris, regardless of the consequences.
        It was a clear message lasting mark that the people of Indonesia considered the defense of 
        Pakistan as their own personal duty. The alliance was so strong that Indonesia 
        offered to provide military hardware to Pakistan immediately.
